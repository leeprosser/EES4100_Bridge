This project has been developed as part of the assessment for an undergraduate course.  

The project requires the reading in of a dataset from a modbus server.  The bacnet_server (this project) puts the data stream in a linked list.  the linked list is then sent to the bacnet_client when a read request is made from a bacnet_client.
